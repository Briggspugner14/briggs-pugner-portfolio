## Abstract
Blood cell heterogeneity and activation play crucial roles in inflammatory responses and immune disorders. Variations in morphology, mechanical properties, and biochemical composition serve as key indicators of these conditions. This research presents an AI-assisted imaging flow cytometry (AIFC) system designed for real-time blood cell classification. Utilizing a pretrained AI model, the system automatically detects and categorizes blood cells from microscopy images while simultaneously measuring cell velocity based on pixel displacement and frame rate. To enhance precision and control, the velocity data feeds into a closed-loop system that dynamically adjusts a custom syringe pump to regulate flow conditions. Additionally, single-cell mechanical properties are extracted by analyzing deformation behavior through constitutive modeling. By integrating AI-driven classification with adaptive fluidic control, this next-generation AIFC system provides a high-throughput, automated platform for precise single-cell analysis. Its potential applications include the diagnosis of hemolytic diseases, immune disorders, and other blood-related conditions.

## Detailed Content

### Overview
The AIFC system represents a breakthrough in automated blood cell analysis, combining cutting-edge microfluidic technology with advanced artificial intelligence. This integrated approach enables real-time classification of individual blood cells as they flow through a custom-designed microfluidic channel, providing unprecedented accuracy and speed for diagnostic applications. The system addresses the critical need for understanding blood cell heterogeneity and activation in inflammatory responses and immune disorders by analyzing variations in morphology, mechanical properties, and biochemical composition.

### Objectives
- Develop an adaptive flow control system for precise cell positioning and velocity management
- Implement AI-assisted image analysis using pretrained models for automated cell detection and classification
- Train a YOLOv8-based neural network for high-accuracy RBC and WBC classification
- Create a closed-loop system integrating flow control with real-time imaging feedback
- Extract single-cell mechanical properties through deformation behavior analysis
- Achieve high-throughput automated classification suitable for clinical diagnostics
- Enable diagnosis of hemolytic diseases, immune disorders, and blood-related conditions

### Technical Approach

#### Adaptive Flow Control
A custom microfluidic chip enables precise control of cell position and velocity using a closed-loop system with real-time feedback from imaging data. The system continuously monitors cell flow and adjusts parameters to maintain optimal conditions for imaging and analysis.

#### AI-Assisted Image Analysis
Utilizing a pretrained AI model, the system automatically detects and categorizes blood cells from microscopy images. Individual cells are detected and annotated manually with Label Studio software for training data preparation. These annotated cells are segmented and labeled as RBCs or WBCs for training the neural network, ensuring high-quality training data for accurate classification.

#### Neural Network Classification
The cell images train a YOLOv8-based neural network for automated cell classification. Training data was split into a training set and validation set to assess model performance, with precision for RBC classification reaching 0.943 and WBC classification achieving 0.706.

#### Closed-loop Velocity Measurement
Cell velocity is assessed by analyzing pixel displacement across frames and frame rate, with the velocity data feeding into a closed-loop system that dynamically adjusts a custom syringe pump to regulate flow conditions. This ensures consistent imaging conditions and optimal analysis results.

#### Mechanical Properties Analysis
Single-cell mechanical properties are extracted by analyzing deformation behavior through constitutive modeling. This analysis provides insights into cell stiffness, elasticity, and other mechanical characteristics that serve as key indicators of cell health and activation states.

### Key Contributions
- Developed an integrated AIFC system combining microfluidic control with computer vision

The integrated approach significantly increases efficiency and accuracy of cell classification, making it suitable for point-of-care and diagnostic laboratory applications. The system successfully demonstrates the potential for automated blood cell analysis in clinical settings. Additionally, the mechanical properties analysis provides valuable insights into cell deformation behavior, enabling characterization of cell stiffness and elasticity as indicators of cell health and activation states.

### Discussion and Conclusions
