# Mirror Langmuir Probe for MUSE Compact Stellarator

## Abstract
Accurate and time-resolved measurements of plasma parameters are critical
for understanding the dynamics of magnetic confinement devices. In the MUSE
compact stellarator, the need for precise diagnostics is addressed using a high-timeresolution system based on the Mirror Langmuir Probe (MLP). Unlike conventional
Langmuir probes, which sweep across a wide range of bias voltages, the MLP rapidly
cycles through pre-selected voltages to extract electron temperature (Te), electron
density (ne), and floating potential (Vf ) from a single probe tip. This rapid cycling
enables spatially and temporally localized measurements, essential for studying
transient events in the core, edge, and scrape-off layer (SOL) regions.
The MLP system was implemented using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
following the approach described by Vincent et al. [1]. During this internship
project, the focus was on ensuring robust control and data acquisition software,
diagnosing and resolving errors, and rebuilding the code within a Linux virtual
machine using the Koheron make system. The FPGA implementation was subsequently deployed to hardware, and the system was integrated into the MUSE
experimental platform. These efforts establish a foundation for high-fidelity measurements of transient plasma dynamics and demonstrate the feasibility of FPGAbased, high-speed diagnostics in stellarator research.
