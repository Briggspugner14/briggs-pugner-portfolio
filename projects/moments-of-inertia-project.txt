## Detailed Content

### Overview
This project focuses on experimentally determining the moments of inertia for spaceflight objects by spinning them around their three different axes. The experimental setup uses a falling mass system to generate known torque, which is applied to rotate the test object. Angular acceleration is measured using specialized instrumentation connected to a PASCO data acquisition system. The spaceflight object is first modeled in CAD software (Fusion 360), then 3D printed and assembled. Custom mounts are designed and printed to connect the object to the angular acceleration measurement system, ensuring precise alignment and minimal interference with the rotational motion.

### Objectives
- Design and fabricate a spaceflight object using CAD modeling and 3D printing
- Create custom mounting systems to interface with angular acceleration measurement equipment
- Develop experimental procedures for measuring moments of inertia around three orthogonal axes
- Implement a falling mass torque generation system for known torque application
- Integrate PASCO instrumentation for precise angular acceleration data collection
- Analyze experimental data to determine accurate moment of inertia values
- Compare experimental results with theoretical calculations from CAD models

### Technical Approach
The experimental methodology follows a systematic approach to determine moments of inertia:

**CAD Design and Fabrication:**
- Model the spaceflight object in Fusion 360 with precise geometric specifications
- Design custom mounting brackets and interfaces for angular acceleration sensors
- 3D print all components using appropriate materials for structural integrity
- Assemble the complete test object with integrated mounting systems

**Experimental Setup:**
- Implement a falling mass system to generate known torque (τ = mgr, where m is mass, g is gravity, r is radius)
- Connect the test object to angular acceleration measurement instrumentation
- Interface measurement equipment with PASCO data acquisition system for real-time data collection
- Ensure proper alignment of rotational axes to minimize measurement errors

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
- Apply known torque and measure resulting angular acceleration for each axis
- Use the relationship τ = Iα (where I is moment of inertia, α is angular acceleration) to calculate moments of inertia
- Collect multiple data points for statistical analysis and error reduction
- Use Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization of results
